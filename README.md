Getting and Cleaning Data Project
==============


## Project Description ##

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a 
data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  

In more details, the following steps are required to complete the assignment:
    1) a tidy data set as described below;
    2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis; 
    3) a Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed 
    to clean up the data called.

### Data Description:
The data considered for the Project represent data collected from the 
accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the web site where the data was obtained:

## Final Notes:

The provided R script makes assumptions on the location of files to process (dataset).
However, no assumptions is made on the numbers of rows and columns of the data frame
to process during the analysis steps.
